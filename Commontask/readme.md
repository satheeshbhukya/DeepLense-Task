# Commontask: Multi-Class Classification 
## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of images categorized into three classes:
- **No Substructure:** Strong lensing images without substructure.
- **Subhalo Substructure:** Images with subhalo substructure.
- **Vortex Substructure:** Images with vortex substructure.

All images have been normalized using **min-max normalization**.

- **Training Set:** 30,000 images
- **Validation Set:** 7,500 images

## Task
Develop a deep learning model using **PyTorch** or **Keras** to classify the images into one of the three lensing categories.

## Models Trained
The following models were trained and evaluated for classification:
1. **ResNet18**
2. **EfficientNetB4**
## Result
